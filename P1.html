<h1>What I learned so far</h1>

<b>What is running the Web?</b>
<p>What I'am writting right now is a HTML or <em>Hyper Markup Language</em>
  , this language is vastly used in the web.
   Htmls are documents, but they are not the only type of file contained in the web
   , files such as texts, videos, images and music
    are other types of files found on the web.</p>


<b> How does the web work?</b>
<p>The web has three components the browser, internet,<em> HTTP</em> and the servers.
  Using the internet you browser make requests to servers and the servers give the files you requested.
  All this work is in a protocol mentioned above <em> HTTP</em>.<img src="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000-br/parts/d9b13320-09a3-4058-b1fd-3ec3032dc9cf/modules/8f2b6689-b7fd-4c54-9c13-99bb29278990/lessons/9a1a537b-3993-45b8-ad7e-6e44c8d57802/concepts/04c0507c-a53c-4d47-9997-fe491533588c#" alt=alt text></p>

  <b>HTML</b>
  <p><em>Elements</em> are what make an HTML a HTMl. Elements are made of tags and words. Tags are what diferenciate Elements form eachother.
Tags either are void that it doesn't need a pair and the non void that need a start and finish
